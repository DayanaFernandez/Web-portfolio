	<p>The link below is a site I created for a web development course I took as part of my Master's in Applied Information Technology. </p>

<p>The following link is a site I created as my web development case study. But I hope to be able to use it in the near future to promote my translation services.</p>

<p>The following link is a page I created as an initial launch page for part of a project for a cloud computing class. It's very simple because I ended up dropping the course, so this was as far as I got with it, but I still wanted to include it since I worked on it.</p>
